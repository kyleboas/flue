/**
 * Public surface for user-authored `app.ts` entries.
 *
 * Users who customize their server pipeline (custom Hono routes,
 * middleware, request rewriting, auth, custom model providers, etc.)
 * import everything they need from this subpath:
 *
 *     import { flue, registerProvider, type Fetchable } from '@flue/sdk/app';
 *     import { Hono } from 'hono';
 *
 *     registerProvider('my-anthropic', {
 *       api: 'openai-completions',
 *       baseUrl: 'https://api.anthropic.com/v1',
 *       apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY,
 *     });
 *
 *     const app = new Hono();
 *     app.use('*', logger());
 *     app.route('/', flue());
 *     export default app;
 *
 * Why a subpath instead of the SDK root: the root barrel re-exports
 * build-time symbols (`build`, `dev`) that pull in heavy build-only
 * dependencies (notably `typescript` for agent-file parsing). Bundlers
 * for the deploy target — wrangler in particular — walk the entire
 * import graph from a user's `app.ts`, and even with tree-shaking
 * those dependencies sneak into the worker bundle and break at
 * runtime (`__filename is not defined` from the TS lib code that
 * expects Node globals).
 *
 * Splitting the runtime API onto its own subpath fixes this by
 * construction: `@flue/sdk/app` only re-exports runtime values, never
 * touches `build.ts` or `dev.ts`, and stays small in the worker bundle.
 *
 * Connector authors who wire up custom sandboxes still go through
 * `@flue/sdk/sandbox` — that's a separate audience and a separate surface.
